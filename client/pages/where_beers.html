            <h1>There's No Place Like Home</h1>

            <p>
                Tin Whiskers Brewing Company has found a home in St. Paul. Our neighborhood isn't quite downtown, and doesn't have a name (we are working on that). If we were describing it we would say: "Well it's kind of NW of Mears Park, NE of the Xcel Energy Center, south of the freeway where 94 and 35E meet. It's in the Rossmor building... the same building as Sawatdee, Blacksheep Pizza, Key's Cafe, Camp Bar...". The address is 125 E 9th St, St. Paul, Minnesota, 55101.

                We haven't done the math but the new space might just have more windows than walls. 

                For the ceiling height we have done the math. To help you out we have made this quick reference table:
            </p>
            <div class="table-responsive">
                <table class="table">
                    <tr>
                        <th> Unit of Measurement </th>
                        <th> Value </th>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td> English</td>
                        <td> 16ft</td>
                    </tr>
