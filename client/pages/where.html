            <h2>Our Neighborhood</h2>
            <p>
                Tin Whiskers Brewing Company has found a home in St. Paul. Our neighborhood isn't quite downtown, and doesn't have a name (we are working on that). If we were describing it we would say: "Well it's kind of NW of Mears Park, NE of the Xcel Energy Center, south of the freeway where 94 and 35E meet. It's in the Rossmor building... the same building as Sawatdee, Blacksheep Pizza, Key's Cafe, Camp Bar...". 
            </p>
            <h2>Our Taproom</h2>
            <p>
                We haven't done the math but the new space might just have more windows than walls. Our taproom is filled with light during the day, and glows with warm light at night. Look for the robot sign hanging on the building and/or the giant robot mural painted at our entrance and visible from the street. Take a seat at our huge bar overlooking the brewing equipment or grab a seat at one of our many tables with your friends.
