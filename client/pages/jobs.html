        <h1>Tin Whiskers Jobs Board</h1>
        <p>
            The only thing better than drinking beer at Tin Whiskers is working at Tin Whiskers (full disclosure that's partially because each employee gets to drink some free beer). 
        </p> 



        <h2>Fully-Calibrated Precision Beertenders</h2>
        <p>
            Tin Whiskers needs 4.00 self-aware beertenders to efficently and effectively distribute beer to human guests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Job functions will include pouring beer, cleaning everything, educating customers, all while ensuring they associate happy emotions with their visit. In-depth knowledge of craft beer, the brewing process, and serving beer is all highly preferred.
