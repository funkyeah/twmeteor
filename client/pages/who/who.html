                <p>
                    Tin Whiskers is a local open source craft brewery on a mission to make technically excellent beer. Tin Whiskers is opening the book on everything we do. Our goal is to engage and give back to the community by sharing an inside look at opening and operating a craft brewery. We hope that our rapidly rotating beers and open recipes give customers something to taste and talk about.

                    Jake Johnson, Jeff Moriarty, and George Kellerman met at the University of MN. Electrical Engineering Degrees in hand, they found themselves working together for a small engineering services company in downtown Minneapolis. Frequently unable to resist the allure of the 11-6 happy hour (we're looking at you Bar 508 and Pizza Luce) they found themselves with plenty of time to discuss craft beer and how it relates to Life, the Universe and Everything. As engineers, the great interplay between the art and science of brewing beer was a topic of conversation they could never quite shake.

                        <strong>Jake</strong> and <strong>Jeff</strong> are the two
                        brewers and recipe architects. It all began in Jake’s mom’s kitchen in 2006. The two got brewing extract kits, and starting experimenting with boil overs and yeast blow-off tube explosions (ask Jake's mom about her kitchen). For the next 4 years they  brewed countless extract kits. Nowadays, Jake stays focused on the brewing and equipment while Jeff doubles as part brewer master-mind and part businessman.

                        <strong>George</strong>, in the early years, was the muscle. He helped out at every brew session cleaning and moving material around the brew house. He soon turned his focus towards the quality of the beer (basically he is just an extra talented <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/f1zTCrl">Captain Hindsight</a>) but he pushed the brewers to design better more complex beers. Always a big idea kind of guy, he has moved on to be in charge of our brand and online presence.

                        In 2010 inspired by a couple brewery tours and the stories of the founders of Surly and Flat Earth; The three decided to start a business. Come 2011 Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC was born. It’s been all-grain brewing, business planning, working multiple jobs shenanigans ever since and they’ve never looked back.

                    A Tin Whisker is an electrical engineering term for a soldering failure that results in a short circuit on a printed circuit board (PCB). It is caused by a tin “hair” (or whisker) that unintentionally forms between adjacent pins of integrated circuits (ICs) which are the little black parts you'll see on a circuit
                    board. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whisker">Read more on Wikipedia</a>
