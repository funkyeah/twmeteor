        <h1>And Update From the Brewery</h1>

            <h2>March 4, 2013</h2>

            <p>
                Although there is nothing we can officially release, the
                investment process has heated up significantly and we are
                really excited by the progress Tin Whiskers Brewing has
                made recently. Stay tuned on our website in the coming
                weeks as we continue to update our progress and journey as
                an up and coming brewery in the Twin Cities.
            </p>

                To coincide with our investment efforts, we are extremely
                proud to release the Tin Whiskers Brewing Co.â€™s
                promotional video. It offers a condensed behind the scenes
                view of what it takes to brew one of our signature beers,
                Short Circuit Stout. Big thanks to the fine folks at
                Mediagraphy for their hard work on the clip. Enjoy!

            <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>

            <h2>January 3, 2013</h2>
            <p>
                2012 was a big year for Tin Whiskers Brewing Company. Between
                the launching of our website, developing additional online
                presence using social media outlets, as well as getting the
                Tin Whiskers brand out into the St. Paul craft beer
                market. What once started as a hobby boiling over on a gas
                range has evolved into a set up that brews premium craft beer
                by the keg.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For 2013, the number one focus is getting our product available for
                the general public to enjoy. We found the best way to do this was to
                scale back the operation and create a nano-brewery. Through several
                meet and greets with prospective investors, our goal of making this
                dream a reality has been getting closer with every keg tapped. We are
                halfway to reaching our investment funding goal. With your help, we
                can reach our goal and open up our brewery. If you are interested
                learning more, please contact us at
                <a href="mailto:robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com">robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com</a>.
                We look forward to hearing from you.
            </p>

            <h1>Funding Update</h1>

            <h2>July 25, 2012</h2>
            We are hard at work having meetings and discussions with
            various potential investors to close on our capital needs to
            build our brewery. In a matter of months we have secured 25%
            of the funds and are seeking to close on the remainder by
            October. Feel free to
            <a href="mailto:robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com">contact
            us</a> with any comments or questions.

            <h1>The New Site</h1>

            <h2>July 20, 2012</h2>

            <p>
                We are incredibly excited to launch our website. It has taken a lot of hard work by our dedicated
                developer and designer to reach this achievement. Stay tuned as the wiki portion of the site will be
                rolling out in the next few months. Contact us if you have any comments or suggestions on the site.

            <h1>More 20oz Pint Glasses Are In</h1>

            <h2>July 7, 2012</h2>

            We just got in another order of our 20oz pint glasses. They are $10 a piece. The money helps support
            ordering further merchandise like t-shirts that many of you have been asking for. Stop by the pilot
            brewery to get yours today.
