                    The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George
                    Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in
                    2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor
                    degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked
                    together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering
                    services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being
                    young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended
                    various happy hours together.  It quickly became clear that
                    they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with
                    the science of the brewing process.

                        <strong>Jake</strong> and <strong>Jeff</strong> are the two
                        brewers of the company who designed and honed the
                        recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on
                        Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few
                        boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed
                        countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly
                        and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like
                        the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that
                        point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it.
                        Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business
                        while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side
                        of the operation.

                        <strong>George</strong>, in the early years, was a force
                        within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and
                        providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material
                        around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our
                        beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has
                        moved on to be in charge of our online presence including
                        developing our own beer wiki engine.

                <h2>What's a <span class="darker">Tin Whisker</span></h2>
                <p>A Tin Whisker is is an electrical engineering term for a
                    type of product fault that typically has the symptom of a short
                    circuit on the printed circuit board (PCB). It is caused by a tin hair
                    that would grow between adjacent pins of an integrated circuit (IC
                    which are the little black parts you'll see on the circuit
                    board). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whisker">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>
