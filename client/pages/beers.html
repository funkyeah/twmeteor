                                By definition, a short circuit is an abnormal connection between
                                two nodes of an electric circuit, often resulting in overheating,
                                fire or even explosion. To the Tin Whiskers crew, this is a great
                                way to describe the crossover of the distinct roasted flavors from
                                the malts and the sweet aftertaste from the unfermentable lactose
                                added during the boil. If you really want to blow your mind, try
                                it served over vanilla ice cream for a beer float!

                        <p>
                            A flip switch is a mechanism actuating the transition between open
                            and closed states of an electrical circuit. Probably the most
                            common example is a light switch. You know that intense bright
                            light you get when you flip on a good old fashioned light bulb?
                            The kind that almost blinds you until your eyes have a second to
                            adjust? Well the bold hop flavor you experience in the first sip
                            of a Flip Switch is kind of like that, without the blindness of
                            course.

                            Invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833 and improved and
                            popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843, a Wheatstone bridge
                            is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical
                            resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of
                            which includes the unknown component. But don't over think this

                            undoubtedly comes with popularizing someone else's invention.

                            Wheatsone ran short of the money he needed to buy copper-plates

                            had left, a thought occurred, 'We must use the pennies
                            themselves,' he said, and the battery was soon complete.

                            An ampere (or amp) is a unit of electric current named after
                            French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère
                            (1775–1836). In addition to being the father of electrodynamics,
                            Ampère was an all around solid guy, described as having "great
                            amiability and childlike simplicity of character." You could use

                            Schottky Pumpkin Ale is an amber ale with a sweet pumpkin flavor.
                            Made with actual roasted
                            pumpkin and generous amounts of pumpkin pie spice, it is a great
                            beer to enhance any fall meal. It falls into the 21A Spice, Herb,
                            or Vegetable Beer category as identified by the Beer Judge
                            Certification Program (BJCP).

                        <h2>What's With the Name?</h2>
                        <p>
                            This beer is an homage to German physicist Walter H. Schottky
                            (1888-1976) who played a major role in developing the theory of
                            electron and ion emission phenomena. The shape you see carved into
                            the pumpkin on our beer labels is actually the sign for the
                            Schottky diode, which is a semiconductor diode with a low forward
                            voltage drop and a very fast switching action.

                        <p>
                            Schottky died on March 4, 1976 at the age of 90. His death came
                            just two years after his former employer, Siemens, had begun
                            commercially manufacturing Schottky diodes for microwave use.
