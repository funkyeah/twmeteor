                                    Short Circuit Stout is a full-bodied and roasty stout with a
                                    lingering sweet aftertaste. It uses 5 different malts to create a
                                    variety of flavors that change in the course of taking a sip. It
                                    falls into the13B Sweet Stout style category as identified by the
                                    Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP).

                                    By definition, a short circuit is an abnormal connection between
                                    two nodes of an electric circuit, often resulting in overheating,
                                    fire or even explosion. To the Tin Whiskers crew, this is a great
                                    way to describe the crossover of the distinct roasted flavors from
                                    the malts and the sweet aftertaste from the unfermentable lactose
                                    added during the boil. If you really want to blow your mind, try
                                    it served over vanilla ice cream for a beer float!

                                A flip switch is a mechanism actuating the transition between open
                                and closed states of an electrical circuit. Probably the most
                                common example is a light switch. You know that intense bright
                                light you get when you flip on a good old fashioned light bulb?
                                The kind that almost blinds you until your eyes have a second to
                                adjust? Well the bold hop flavor you experience in the first sip
                                of a Flip Switch is kind of like that, without the blindness of
                                course.

                                popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843, a Wheatstone bridge
                                is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical
                                resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of
                                which includes the unknown component. But don't over think this

                                Wheatsone ran short of the money he needed to buy copper-plates

                                Schottky Pumpkin Ale is an amber ale with a sweet pumpkin flavor.
                                Made with actual roasted
                                pumpkin and generous amounts of pumpkin pie spice, it is a great
                                beer to enhance any fall meal. It falls into the 21A Spice, Herb,
                                or Vegetable Beer category as identified by the Beer Judge
                                Certification Program (BJCP).

                                This beer is an homage to German physicist Walter H. Schottky
                                (1888-1976) who played a major role in developing the theory of
                                electron and ion emission phenomena. The shape you see carved into
                                the pumpkin on our beer labels is actually the sign for the
                                Schottky diode, which is a semiconductor diode with a low forward
                                voltage drop and a very fast switching action.

                                Schottky died on March 4, 1976 at the age of 90. His death came
                                just two years after his former employer, Siemens, had begun
                                commercially manufacturing Schottky diodes for microwave use.

                                An ampere (or amp) is a unit of electric current named after
                                French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère
                                (1775–1836). In addition to being the father of electrodynamics,
                                Ampère was an all around solid guy, described as having "great
                                amiability and childlike simplicity of character." You could use
                                these same exact words to describe our solid, year-round Ampere
                                Biere.

                                Andre Marie Ampere was dogged by bad luck. His father, for
                                example, was guillotined during the French Revolution and his wife
                                died shortly after their marriage. On his deathbed in 1836, he
                                ordered that an inscription be placed upon his tombstone: Tandem
                                Felix (Happy at Last).
