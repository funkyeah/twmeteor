            <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>

            <h2>January 3, 2013</h2>
            <p>
                2012 was a big year for Tin Whiskers Brewing Company. Between
                the launching of our website, developing additional online
                presence using social media outlets, as well as getting the
                Tin Whiskers brand out into the St. Paul craft beer
                market. What once started as a hobby boiling over on a gas
                range has evolved into a set up that brews premium craft beer
                by the keg.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For 2013, the number one focus is getting our product available for
                the general public to enjoy. We found the best way to do this was to
                scale back the operation and create a nano-brewery. Through several
                meet and greets with prospective investors, our goal of making this
                dream a reality has been getting closer with every keg tapped. We are
                halfway to reaching our investment funding goal. With your help, we
                can reach our goal and open up our brewery. If you are interested
                learning more, please contact us at
                <a href="mailto:robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com">robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com</a>.
                We look forward to hearing from you.
            </p>

            <h1>Funding Update</h1>

            <h2>July 25, 2012</h2>
            We are hard at work having meetings and discussions with
            various potential investors to close on our capital needs to
            build our brewery. In a matter of months we have secured 25%
            of the funds and are seeking to close on the remainder by
            October. Feel free to
            <a href="mailto:robot@tinwhiskersbrewing.com">contact
            us</a> with any comments or questions.

            <h1>The New Site</h1>

            <h2>July 20, 2012</h2>

            <p>
                We are incredibly excited to launch our website. It has taken a lot of hard work by our dedicated
                developer and designer to reach this achievement. Stay tuned as the wiki portion of the site will be
                rolling out in the next few months. Contact us if you have any comments or suggestions on the site.

            <h1>More 20oz Pint Glasses Are In</h1>

            <h1>One "Devoted connection" to beer.</h1>

            <p>
                The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George
                Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in
                2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor
                degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked
                together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering
                services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being
                young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended
                various happy hours together.  It quickly became clear that
                they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with
                the science of the brewing process.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Jake</strong> and <strong>Jeff</strong> are the two
                brewers of the company who designed and honed the
                recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on
                Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few
                boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed
                countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly
                and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like
                the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that
                point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it.
                Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business
                while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side
                of the operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>George</strong>, in the early years, was a force
                within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and
                providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material
                around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our
                beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has
                moved on to be in charge of our online presence including
                developing our own beer wiki engine.

            <h2>What's a <span class="darker">Tin Whisker</span></h2>
            <p>A Tin Whisker is is an electrical engineering term for a
                type of product fault that typically has the symptom of a short
                circuit on the printed circuit board (PCB). It is caused by a tin hair
                that would grow between adjacent pins of an integrated circuit (IC
                which are the little black parts you'll see on the circuit
                board). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whisker">Read more on Wikipedia</a></p>

                                        Short Circuit Stout is a full-bodied and roasty stout with a
                                        lingering sweet aftertaste. It uses 5 different malts to create a
                                        variety of flavors that change in the course of taking a sip. It
                                        falls into the13B Sweet Stout style category as identified by the
                                        Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP).

                                    <p>
                                        By definition, a short circuit is an abnormal connection between
                                        two nodes of an electric circuit, often resulting in overheating,
                                        fire or even explosion. To the Tin Whiskers crew, this is a great
                                        way to describe the crossover of the distinct roasted flavors from
                                        the malts and the sweet aftertaste from the unfermentable lactose
                                        added during the boil. If you really want to blow your mind, try
                                        it served over vanilla ice cream for a beer float!

                                    A flip switch is a mechanism actuating the transition between open
                                    and closed states of an electrical circuit. Probably the most
                                    common example is a light switch. You know that intense bright
                                    light you get when you flip on a good old fashioned light bulb?
                                    The kind that almost blinds you until your eyes have a second to
                                    adjust? Well the bold hop flavor you experience in the first sip
                                    of a Flip Switch is kind of like that, without the blindness of
                                    course.

                                    popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843, a Wheatstone bridge
                                    is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical
                                    resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of
                                    which includes the unknown component. But don't over think this

                                    (1888-1976) who played a major role in developing the theory of
                                    electron and ion emission phenomena. The shape you see carved into
                                    the pumpkin on our beer labels is actually the sign for the
                                    Schottky diode, which is a semiconductor diode with a low forward
                                    voltage drop and a very fast switching action.

                                    Schottky died on March 4, 1976 at the age of 90. His death came
                                    just two years after his former employer, Siemens, had begun
                                    commercially manufacturing Schottky diodes for microwave use.

                                    Ampere Biere is a light-bodied Bière de Garde style French ale
                                    with just the right amount of malty sweetness. It's a smooth and
                                    refreshing beer to drink year round. It falls into the 16D Bière
                                    de Garde category as identified by the Beer Judge Certification
                                    Program (BJCP).

                                    An ampere (or amp) is a unit of electric current named after
                                    French mathematician and physicist André-Marie Ampère
                                    (1775–1836). In addition to being the father of electrodynamics,
                                    Ampère was an all around solid guy, described as having "great
                                    amiability and childlike simplicity of character." You could use
                                    these same exact words to describe our solid, year-round Ampere
                                    Biere.

                                    Andre Marie Ampere was dogged by bad luck. His father, for
                                    example, was guillotined during the French Revolution and his wife
                                    died shortly after their marriage. On his deathbed in 1836, he
                                    ordered that an inscription be placed upon his tombstone: Tandem
                                    Felix (Happy at Last).
